SPV Litecoin wallet C library

We have taken the breadwallet-core library and made changes to make it better for SPV clients like [Brainwallet](https://www.brainwallet.co)
We reconize that there are other more modern libraries but the existing user base means we intend to fully optimize this library and use it to its full potential
